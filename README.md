# Feed Reader Project

### Features of the app

The Feed Reader meets all of the Udacity project requirements by providing the following features:
* The required tests for the project (RSS Feed testing, RSS Feed properties, menu default state, and menu hiding/showing) are all provided and are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality.
* Test are independent of one another.
* All required tests for the project pass.
